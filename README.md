# Bachelor Thesis Project: AI-Powered Seizure Prediction with CHB-MIT Dataset
Supervisor: Dr. Golnaz Baghdadi
#### *In Progress!!*

This repository contains the code, data, and reports related to my bachelor thesis project, which focuses on EEG data analysis using the CHB-MIT dataset. The project is organized into several stages, with the current focus on preprocessing and feature extraction.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Codes**: Contains all the Jupyter Notebooks used in this project, including scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, and more.
- **Sample Data**: Includes sample EEG data from the CHB-MIT dataset used for testing and development purposes.
- **Preprocessed Data**: Stores the EEG data after it has been preprocessed, ready for feature extraction or further analysis.
- **Presentations and Reports**: Contains weekly reports, presentations, and documentation that outline the progress and findings of the project.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the **CHB-MIT EEG dataset**, a publicly available dataset that consists of EEG recordings from pediatric patients with intractable seizures. The dataset is widely used for epilepsy research and seizure detection studies.

## Current Progress

### 1. Preprocessing

The preprocessing stage involves cleaning and preparing the raw EEG data for analysis. The steps include:

- **Artifact Removal**: Identifying and removing artifacts such as eye blinks, muscle movements, and other noise from the EEG signals.
- **Filtering**: Applying band-pass filters to isolate the relevant frequency bands for seizure detection (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta).
- **Normalization**: Standardizing the EEG signals to ensure consistency across different recordings and subjects.

**Notebook**: `Preprocessing.ipynb`

### 2. Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is the process of transforming the preprocessed EEG data into a set of meaningful features that can be used for further analysis, such as machine learning models for seizure detection. The steps include:

- **Time-Domain Features**: Extracting features such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis from the EEG signals.
- **Frequency-Domain Features**: Applying techniques like Fourier Transform to extract features related to the frequency components of the EEG signals.
- **Entropy Measures**: Calculating the entropy of the EEG signals to quantify the complexity and irregularity of the brain activity.

**Notebook**: `Feature_Extraction.ipynb`

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Navigate to the `Codes` folder and open `Preprocessing.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the raw EEG data.
   - The preprocessed data will be saved in the `Preprocessed Data` folder.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Open the `Feature_Extraction.ipynb` notebook in the `Codes` folder.
   - Execute the cells to extract features from the preprocessed EEG data.
   - The extracted features can be saved for later use in machine learning models or further analysis.

## Sample Data

The `Sample Data` folder contains a subset of the CHB-MIT EEG dataset used for testing and development. This data can be used to understand and verify the preprocessing and feature extraction steps before applying them to the full dataset.

## Reports and Presentations

The `Presentations and Reports` folder includes all the documentation related to this project. This includes:

- **Weekly Reports**: Detailed reports outlining the progress made each week, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.
- **Presentations**: Slides from presentations given during the project, summarizing key findings and methodologies.

## Future Work

- **Model Development**: In upcoming stages, I plan to develop machine learning models for seizure detection using the extracted features.
- **Validation and Testing**: The models will be validated and tested on the full CHB-MIT dataset to evaluate their performance.
- **Further Feature Engineering**: Additional features and methods will be explored to improve the accuracy and robustness of the seizure detection models.
